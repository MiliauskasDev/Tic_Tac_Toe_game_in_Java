<b>A *Simple Tic-Tac-Toe (Java)* project created as part of my learning journey on Hyperskill.</b>

<p>This is a command line based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Java. This project was created with the intention of practicing MVC design pattern and to refresh my memory on working with Java. The whole game was written with the goal of adapting this game to work on a browser (I will eventually be developing a browser based command line tool for running my various Java based projects).

The game is based on a project on Hyperskill: https://hyperskill.org/projects/48
